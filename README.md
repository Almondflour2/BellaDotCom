I discovered Gatsby one day by looking at the wonderful portfolio website made by <a href="https://brittanychiang.com/">Brittany Chiang</a>. Her website is clean, elegant, easy to read, and generously links to her Github repo! I saw 'Gatsby' and was immediately intrigued because as a developer with a new focus on the web, I want to know about as many new web technologies as possible. 

So far, Gatsby is proving to be a great way to learn React. Gatsby is well documented and extremely user friendly. The company's culture shines through in their tutorials. I'm really happy that I found it! (I even ordered a T-Shirt from them to wear as a pump cover.) With it, I'm going to create a user-friendly site that shows off my experience and coding methods.  Headless architecture like this one shifts the user interface entirely into the browser, making the site faster and creating a better front-end development experience. You might think that Gatsby would be focusing all their energy on making the web better for their <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/showcase/">clients such as Figma and Little Caesar's,</a> but they spend effort and time to make an elegant and efficient development experience for someone making a personal website.

This was a testing ground. I learned how Gatsby uses GraphQL and how to use its GraphiQL tool to create programmatically written content & how to dynamically render styles with JSX. Expect a cleaner, commented site soon with a project plan for my very own portfolio site. 

See you soon!
